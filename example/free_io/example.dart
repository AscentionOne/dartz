// Technique: Construct referentially transparent program using monadic sequencing.

//            if, how, when and/or where it will be interpreted.

  // Referentially transparent, since execution is only affected by the input vector argument.
  print(await mockPerformIO(greeter, ivector(["Bj√∂rn", "dartz", "q"])));

  // Interpret IO program using side-effecting console interpreter.
  // _NOT_ referentially transparent, since execution is affected by whatever the user inputs in the console.
  unsafePerformIO(greeter);

  // Now imagine an interpreter that takes input from a DOM 'input' element and writes output to a DOM 'ul' element.
  // ...or an interpreter that reads and writes from/to REST services using XHR/fetch.
  // Regardless of the interpreter used, 'greeter' remains unchanged.
